              <h2>Message from the Chairman</h2>
              <p>
                To be the best brand committed to excellence in all our
                endeavors
              </p>
              <p>
                – Moinuddin Hasan Rashid, Chairman &amp;&nbsp;Managing Director
              </p>
              <p>
                United Group, a multi-disciplinary business house, has proven
                itself to be a dynamic and progressive enterprise, positioning
                itself as one of the leading business houses of the country. We
                are now working to achieve being the best brand committed to
                excellence in all our endeavors – our long-term management
                vision. This calls for us to create a robust platform capable of
                delivering consistent growth under any condition.
              </p>
              <p>
                By the Grace of Almighty, we are certainly privileged to have
                received the strongest of platforms as gifts from our founding
                directors. They have presented us with a healthy financial base,
                strong asset backing, a company without debt and liabilities, a
                timely and forward-thinking succession planning and lastly, an
                undeniable reputation in the market.
              </p>
              <p>
                We have been concentrating on implementing succession planning
                and restructuring the business units for the last 4-5 years.
                Alongside asset and capital, development of human resource are
                crucial to achieve the vision that we have set for the company.
                In fact, we believe that our effective human resource is the
                next big ingredient to drive us to tomorrow. The Group presently
                employs around 7,800 individuals where female representation
                stands at around 20% and more than 50% of our employees are
                professionals. Our structure is such that the top line
                executives are experienced professionals fostering youth
                leadership as the middle and bottom lines are the young leaders
                of tomorrow. The average age of our employee stands at around 35
                years where most of these young professionals have been working
                with us for around 7-8 years already! We have set a target of
                creating 15,000 value added employment out of which we hope to
                achieve the 10,000 employment by the end of 2019, owing to the
                number of ongoing construction projects that are scheduled to
                come into operation by that time. In 2018 alone, we have
                invested about Taka 30 lacs for human resource development in
                the form of training both home and abroad. The management of
                United is working hard to give the best working environment and
                a healthy culture that encourages bonding and interaction among
                the employees, increasing their comfort level.
              </p>
              <p>
                United has built a strong repute of thinking out of the box as
                we continue to present the nation with innovative solutions to
                cater to the socio-infrastructural needs of the country. From
                the first private sector power plant in the country to the first
                private land port, we have presented the nation with many of its
                first of a kind projects.
              </p>
              <p>
                Establishing a 200 MW HFO fired power plant with complete fuel
                storage and handling facilities in a mere 6 months has been so
                far one of the boldest of our projects. The project earned the
                recognition of being the Best Power Producer in 2018 at the
                National Energy &amp; Power Week. At present, United’s power
                plant is supplying 900 MW to the national grid.
              </p>
              <p>
                We are blessed with a series of upcoming projects- Power
                Projects of 615 MW, IPCO, Shipping, Tank Terminal, United City
                in Satarkul, Unimart expansion and many more in the pipeline.
                With 615 MW of power generation facilities under construction,
                600 MW more in the pipeline and a subsidiary having the largest
                market cap in fuel &amp; power sector, we are well posed to
                retain commendable presence in the power sector. Most of our
                power assets are now debt-free and UPGDCL, the 1st commercial
                independent power plant of the Bangladesh has been listed. These
                steps will catapult United to the next level – to undertake
                bigger projects and create value for people of Bangladesh.
              </p>
              <p>
                We have developed and structured an engineering, procurement and
                construction team which has the largest EPC Experience in
                Bangladesh. Our O&amp;M team, United Engineering &amp; Power
                Services Ltd. is committed to providing successful operation and
                maintenance services to all our power plants.

                We have not limited our drive to improving standard of living
                through commercial ventures only. We want our employees to
                experience the same standards of living that we are endeavoring
                to develop. In this view, in addition to developing and
                constructing residential and commercial spaces, we are also
                developing an Executive Complex at United’s township project at
                United City to house our employees.

                Our goal is to continue the path towards sustainable growth as
                we set our focus on Infrastructure, Real Estate and CSR. We will
                remain one of the foremost investors and developers in
                Bangladesh in the Infrastructure sector as the process of
                diversification continues, parallelly. We have set forth an
                investment target of USD 200 million over the next 3 years. We
                believe in greater good of mankind and as such have not
                forgotten the community around us. United Trust was formed in
                2010 as the social welfare organ of the Group with a vision to
                serve socially disadvantageous population of our country. We
                believe United exists to serve United Trust and it is in this
                view United will be injecting the majority of its turnover to
                United Trust after meeting the above investment target.
              </p>
              <p>
                We at United have a mission to remain committed to the
                socio-economic development of the country as we continue to
                enhance value for our stakeholders. We seek to deliver a better
                tomorrow as a socially responsible corporate entity through
                supporting community development activities; embodying the
                values of entrepreneurial leadership and integrity.
