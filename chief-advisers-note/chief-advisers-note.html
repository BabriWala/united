              <h2>Message from the Chief Advisor</h2>
              <p>
                Beginning our journey in 1978, we set up a course to establish a
                name that will eventually become one of the most trusted
                business houses in the country. Looking back at the 40 wonderful
                years that we have travelled in this path, the journey has not
                been easy, but immensely fruitful, nevertheless. Over the years
                we have set a course to be the best brand committed to
                excellence in all our endeavors. Our elemental strength is our
                ability to adopt the present day challenges while we also attend
                to our individual responsibilities to the society and our nation
                at large.<br /><br />United was conceived as a business entity
                committed to socio economic development of the country as we
                continuously enhance value for our stakeholders. United’s
                obligation is not limited only to its investors; United has
                never failed to uphold its responsibilities to all those who are
                impacted by its operation as an economic entity.
              </p>

              >
                <p>
                  We have a duty towards our country, the Government being one
                  of our key stakeholders. United has earned recognition of
                  being the highest value added tax payer in the country,
                  through one of its concerns. All relevant taxes and duties are
                  a paid in time.
                </p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>
                All relevant taxes and duties are a paid in time and all our
                businesses are conducted in adherence to the rules and
                regulations applicable for the businesses.<br /><br />We are
                selective when it comes to implementing projects, our major
                selection criteria being the scope for value addition to the
                society and the economy. We have introduced a number of
                pioneering solutions to various sectors of the country, namely
                infrastructural projects such as power plants. We believe in
                working hand in hand with the government and congratulate the
                government’s initiate on Public-Private Partnership projects.<br /><br />We
                are also hopeful about our ongoing Real estate projects such as
                United City a township project located in Satarkul Dhaka and
                IPCO Developments (Bangladesh) Ltd. We are setting up a
                High-Tech IT Park approved by BEPZA within United City.<br /><br />We
                have braved unchartered territories, without hesitating to
                shoulder the “all-risk” package. From establishing the first
                Independent Power Plant in Khulna to the first, and till date
                the only, private Land Port between Myanmar and Bangladesh at
                Teknaf, United has been a tale of many firsts over the past 4
                decades.
              </p>
              <p>

                portfolio, spanning from healthcare to education, power

                multi-various industries to our employees.
              </p>
              <p>
                Human capital are our most important assets and investing in
                them for their development remains to be one of our core
                business strengths. For the betterment of the employees we are
                providing Medical &amp; Insurance Facilities, interest free loan

                In future we have plan to provide transport facilities to the
                employees.<br /><br />Bangladesh has been a nation truly blessed
                by mother nature. The natural resources and the terrains
                embedded in the folds of this small country is a gift. As
                business house operating on this very land, we have an
                obligation to take care of the environment around us. We have
                adopted environment friendly practices. Our power plants have
                ISO certification, we use multi-stage processes in our power
                plants to reduce the burden on precious fossil fuels, our
                industries have closed loop ventilation systems. Our project
                design teams prioritize efficiency in both construction and
                operations stages as it is only through efficiency can we ensure
                less consumption from the nature and reduced emissions to the
                nature.<br /><br />Last but not the least remains the duty to
                our community. Through United Trust we intend to inject our
                blessings back to the society. United Trust is the social
                welfare organ of United and has been focusing on critical issues
                such as rural education, health and sanitation, poverty
                alleviation and community service. United shall keep patronizing
                United Trust as much as they required in their endeavor to
                contribute to the community.<br /><br />We believe in growing
                together. United has evolved together with the nation and if the
                Almighty wishes, shall continue to match pace and support the
                growth of the nation as Bangladesh moves onto its next growth
                chapter.<br /><br />We are United to build the nation and take
                care of the community around us.
